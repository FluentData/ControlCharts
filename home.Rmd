# Control Charts from `qicharts2`

This app can be used to create control charts for data uploaded as a .csv file.
The charts are generated using the 
[`qicharts2` package](https://anhoej.github.io/qicharts2/).


## `r fa("upload")` Upload Data

Use the Upload Data sidebar item to upload your dataset. The file must be a flat
comma separated (.csv) file with headers.

## `r fa("project-diagram")` Data Typing

The Data Typing sidebar item allows you to categorize the type of data you are
uploading so that the right control chart can be selected. The selections are
based on the flow chart on page 151 of [The Health Care Data Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Health-Care-Data-Guide-Improvement/dp/0470902582/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+health+care+data+guide&qid=1569593782&sr=8-1).

## `r fa("chart-line")` Control Chart

Once your data is uploaded and it's type is categorized, the Control Chart
sidebar item can be used to create a control chart that can be downloaded.
